   <h1>Matthew Almazan</h1>
    <p class="maininfo">I am a rising Junior at Occidental College. I am intending to major in economics and minor in computer science.
    I have a passion for learning languages of all kinds, including computer languages. Hopefully in the future, I can
    incorporate my love for languages and my knowledge in economics to work in a career I am passionate about.
